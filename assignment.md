## Guidelines for the projects

This year, your assignment in the projects is to choose an article from the list provided below, understand it, and, most importantly, **try to replicate the experiments**.

Rules are as follows:
- Projects are conducted by **team of 4 students**. Team members are responsible for decompose the work so that all members contribute meaningfully to the project.

The following deliverables are expected:
1. Before **January 15th 2026**, the **choice of the paper** and the names of the members of the team.
2. **February 19th 2026** - **Final report**: 10 pages (strict. Reports longer than 10 pages will not be read!)

The intermediary report and the final report must be turned down in the ICML (Int. Conf. on Machine Learning) format for [papers](https://icml.cc).

The deliverables will be evaluated taking into account:

- The **clarity of the analysis of the chosen article**. The paper should briefly present, in no more than two to four pages (out of the 10 allotted), the problem studied in the article, the main ideas and statements presented in the paper. The remaining pages will present the experiments carried out by the team, the possible difficulties, the results obtained and a comparison with the results presented by the authors of the article used as a basis for the project.

- The **rigor** and the extensive character of the analysis and/or the experiments carried out. A project that really answers the questions and possible doubts of the reviewers on the interest of the method and on the announced performances will obtain a higher score.

- Expression, **clarity of explanation** and quality of exposition. Reports can be written in French or English, as long as they are clear and well written.
